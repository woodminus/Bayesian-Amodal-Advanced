# Bayesian-Amodal-Advanced

This is an advanced version of the Bayesian Amodal segmentation project, originally submitted for CVPR 2022. The project now uses out-of-task and out-of-distribution generalization to improve upon the existing Bayesian model, resulting in enhanced performance and efficiency in amodal segmentation.
